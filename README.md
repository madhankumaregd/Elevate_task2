## Objective
I used Power BI to turn sales data into pictures that tell a story about the business.

## Tools Used
- Power BI Desktop
- GitHub

## Dataset
Sample - Superstore.csv (sales data from a fictional store)

## Key Insights (My Story)
1.  **Technology is our winner!** This category makes the most profit.
2.  **Furniture is a problem.** We actually lose money on Tables and Bookcases, probably because of high discounts.
3.  **The West region sells the most.** We should focus our marketing there.
4.  **High discounts hurt us.** When discounts go above 30%, we often lose money on the sale.
5.  **Regular customers (Consumer segment)** buy the most stuff.

## Summary
This dashboard shows that we're doing great with Technology products in the West, but we're losing money on Furniture. We should stop discounting furniture so much and maybe try to sell more Technology products in the South region, which is currently our lowest-performing area.
